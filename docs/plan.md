# FreeLook — Design & Implementation Plan

## Overview

FreeLook is a macOS Quick Look Preview Extension that provides syntax-highlighted
previews for developer file types: Markdown, JSON, XML, and source code in common
programming languages. It is distributed via GitHub Releases (signed + notarized DMG)
with Sparkle-based auto-update, not through the App Store.

Every implementation step should be small enough to verify independently. The
required gate after each step is: `./scripts/build` passes without warnings, all
existing unit tests pass without warnings, the user confirms the result manually
when applicable, and a version-control baseline is created before the next step
starts.

---

## Architecture

### Xcode Project

Two targets inside `FreeLook/FreeLook.xcodeproj`:

- `FreeLook` — host macOS app; provides the required container for the extension,
  a settings UI for theme selection, and the Sparkle update framework.
- `QuickLookExtension` — Quick Look Preview Extension; renders file content inside a
  `WKWebView`.

Both targets share an App Group (`group.net.paradigmx.FreeLook`) for `UserDefaults`
preference exchange.

### JS Rendering Pipeline

A standalone npm sub-project lives in `WebRenderer/` and is built separately with
esbuild. Its output, `bundle.js`, is committed/copied into
`QuickLookExtension/Resources/` and loaded by the extension's `WKWebView`.

The renderer exposes a single entry point:

```js
FreeLook.render({ content, lang, lightTheme, darkTheme })
```

File-type routing inside the renderer:

| `lang` value | Pipeline |
|---|---|
| `"markdown"` | markdown-it + @shikijs/markdown-it (code blocks highlighted inline) |
| `"json"` | `JSON.parse` → `JSON.stringify(_, null, 2)` → Shiki `json` |
| `"xml"` | xml-formatter → Shiki `xml` |
| anything else | Shiki with the provided lang string |

### Swift ↔ WKWebView Contract

1. `PreviewViewController` reads the file (`FileHandle`, UTF-8 then Latin-1 fallback,
   500 KB cap — larger files show a truncation notice).
2. `UTIMapper.swift` converts the file's `UTType` to a Shiki language identifier string.
3. `SettingsStore` reads `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` from the shared App Group
   `UserDefaults`.
4. A string-interpolated `template.html` is passed to `loadHTMLString(_:baseURL:)`;
   `baseURL` points to the extension's `Resources/` bundle directory so that relative
   paths to `bundle.js` and `styles.css` resolve correctly.

---

## Theme System

Users independently choose one light theme and one dark theme in the host app settings.
The selected theme names are stored in App Group `UserDefaults` under the keys
`lightTheme` and `darkTheme`.

Shiki's dual-theme CSS variable mechanism handles automatic `prefers-color-scheme`
switching at render time — no JavaScript theme-switching is performed after initial
render.

### Bundled Themes

Light: GitHub Light, One Light, Catppuccin Latte, Nord Light, Solarized Light
Dark: GitHub Dark, One Dark Pro, Catppuccin Mocha, Nord, Dracula

---

## UTI Coverage

The extension's `Info.plist` declares `QLSupportedContentTypes`:

- `public.source-code` — parent UTI; covers the majority of language subtypes
- Priority explicit declarations: `public.swift-source`, `public.python-script`,
  `com.netscape.javascript-source`, `public.typescript-source`, `public.css`,
  `public.html`, `public.shell-script`, `public.ruby-script`
- `net.daringfireball.markdown`
- `public.json`
- `public.xml`

---

## Auto-Update (Sparkle)

FreeLook uses the [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) framework for automatic
updates. The CI release workflow runs `generate_appcast` to update `appcast.xml`
in the repository root after each release. The host app checks the appcast URL on
launch and notifies the user when an update is available.

Required setup:

1. Generate an EdDSA key pair with Sparkle's `generate_keys` tool; store the private
   key as the `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub Secret (base64-encoded).
2. Add the corresponding public key to `Info.plist` as `SUPublicEDKey`.
3. Set `SUFeedURL` in `Info.plist` to:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neolee/freelook/main/appcast.xml`

## Implementation Phases

The original phase boundaries are still correct, but several items were too large
for the required build-test-review-baseline workflow. The phase breakdown below
splits each phase into smaller implementation steps that should each fit in one
checkpoint.

### Phase 1 — Project Skeleton

1.1 Baseline skeleton
- Confirm the Xcode project skeleton, both targets, the `Tests` target, App Group
  entitlement, and deletion of the unused template preview files.
- Verification gate: clean `./scripts/build`; unit tests; user confirms the
  repository baseline.

1.2 Programmatic preview container
- Replace the nib-based extension view with a full-safe-area programmatic
  `WKWebView` shell in `PreviewViewController`.
- Keep the first pass focused on layout and loading-state plumbing only; do not
  mix in file parsing or JS rendering yet.
- Verification gate: clean build; unit tests; user manually confirms the extension
  loads the new container without layout regressions.

1.3 `UTI` mapping and tests
- Implement `UTIMapper.swift` with `UTType` → `Shiki` language mappings.
- Rename `Tests/Tests.swift` to `Tests/UTIMapperTests.swift` and add representative
  coverage for Markdown, JSON, XML, Swift, Python, JavaScript, shell script, and
  generic source code.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user confirms the tested
  mapping surface is sufficient before moving on.

1.4 Bounded file loading
- Implement file reading with UTF-8 first, Latin-1 fallback, and a 500 KB cap.
- If useful, extract decoding/size-limit helpers so they can be tested directly.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user manually checks at
  least one small file and one oversized file path.

1.5 Shared settings persistence
- Add `SettingsStore.swift` and wire App Group `UserDefaults` round-trip for
  `lightTheme` and `darkTheme`.
- Keep this step limited to persistence and model code; defer the full UI to
  Phase 3.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user confirms settings
  persist across relaunches or extension reloads.

### Phase 2 — JS Rendering Pipeline

2.1 Renderer project bootstrap
- Create `WebRenderer/` with `package.json`, `esbuild.config.mjs`, and the initial
  `src/renderer.js` entry point.
- Install and pin `shiki`, `markdown-it`, `@shikijs/markdown-it`,
  `xml-formatter`, and `esbuild`.
- Verification gate: clean native build; full unit test suite; user reviews the
  JS project scaffold before renderer logic is added.

2.2 Core renderer implementation
- Implement file-type routing in `renderer.js`.
- Initialize `Shiki` with `createJavaScriptRegexEngine()` and configure the bundled
  light/dark theme set.
- Verification gate: clean native build; full unit test suite; user reviews the JS
  implementation before asset bundling.

2.3 Bundled extension resources
- Build `bundle.js` and add it to `QuickLookExtension/Resources/`.
- Add `template.html` and `styles.css` so the extension has a stable local HTML
  shell for the renderer.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user confirms the bundled
  resources are present and versioned correctly.

2.4 Swift-to-renderer integration
- Pass file contents, lang, and selected themes from Swift into the HTML template.
- Verify end-to-end rendering for Markdown, JSON, XML, and representative source
  files.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user manually validates
  rendering output in Quick Look before Phase 3 starts.

### Phase 3 — Theme Settings UI

3.1 Theme catalog and preview sample
- Finalize the theme list exposed by `SettingsStore` and the sample content used
  for previews.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user confirms the theme
  catalog and sample snippet.

3.2 Settings UI
- Implement `SettingsView` with independent light/dark theme pickers.
- Keep this step focused on UI structure and persistence bindings.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user confirms the settings
  UI layout and interaction model.

3.3 Live preview and propagation
- Add the live preview `WKWebView` in the host app and verify changes propagate to
  the extension on the next preview.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user manually checks theme
  changes in both the host app preview and Quick Look.

### Phase 4 — Polish

4.1 UTI registration
- Declare the full supported UTI list in `QuickLookExtension/Info.plist`.
- Test representative file types to confirm the extension is triggered reliably.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user manually confirms file
  association behavior.

4.2 Error and fallback states
- Add explicit UI states for unreadable encoding and oversized files.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user manually validates the
  error states.

4.3 Typography and reading comfort
- Refine font size, line height, padding, and optional line numbers.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user reviews readability
  before additional polish.

4.4 Product polish assets
- Deliver the remaining product-facing assets such as the About window and bundled
  open-source license list.
- `AppIcon` can be completed independently once the asset catalog is stable; it
  does not need to block the runtime implementation path.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user signs off on the
  product polish set.

### Phase 5 — Release

5.1 Sparkle target integration
- Add Sparkle to the `FreeLook` target and wire the host app updater setup.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user confirms updater
  integration scope before release configuration.

5.2 Export configuration
- Create `exportOptions.plist` for Developer ID export.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user reviews export
  settings.

5.3 Signing metadata
- Generate the Sparkle EdDSA key pair, add the public key to `Info.plist`, store
  the private key in GitHub Secrets, and set `SUFeedURL`.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user confirms release
  metadata values before CI changes are relied on.

5.4 CI release validation
- Verify the GitHub Actions workflow end to end: archive, export, notarize,
  staple, DMG, appcast update, and GitHub Release creation.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user confirms the release
  pipeline behavior.

5.5 End-user installation docs
- Write `README.md` installation instructions, including the first-launch
  Gatekeeper bypass flow.
- Verification gate: clean build; full unit test suite; user reviews the release
  documentation before the first public release.

## Key Dependencies

| Dependency | Version constraint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Sparkle | ^2.x | Auto-update framework (SPM) |
| shiki | ^1.x | Syntax highlighting (JS engine, no WASM) |
| markdown-it | ^14.x | Markdown parsing |
| @shikijs/markdown-it | ^1.x | Shiki integration for markdown-it |
| xml-formatter | ^3.x | XML pretty-printing |
| esbuild | ^0.24.x | JS bundle build tool |

---

## Constraints and Decisions

- **No WASM**: Shiki is initialized with `createJavaScriptRegexEngine()` to avoid
  WebAssembly binary loading inside the sandboxed App Extension.
- **No App Store**: distribution is Developer ID signed + notarized DMG via GitHub
  Releases only.
- **Sparkle auto-update**: `appcast.xml` lives in the repo root and is updated by CI
  on every tagged release.
- **min macOS 14.6 Sonoma**: enables modern SwiftUI APIs and CSS `light-dark()`.
- **500 KB file cap**: prevents the Quick Look extension from hitting sandbox memory
  limits on very large files.
- **Single extension, multiple UTIs**: one `FreeLookExtension` target covers all
  supported file types; no per-format split.
